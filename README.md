# RelaxPy
A repository that is associated with the manuscript RelaxPy by Wilkinson, Mauro, and Mauro

The script RelaxPy is a tool for glass scientist to be able to analyze several aspects of their samples via an efficient 
differential solver.

It relies on the fit_params_PronyToKWW.txt file for a database for associated relaxation coefficients.

Example.txt is an example file.

Proper usage is:
  python RelaxPy-v01.py Example.txt [-all] [output.txt]
